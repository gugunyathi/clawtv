1
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,620


2
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,940
Yes, it is.

3
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,800
Why are they all looking at me?

4
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,560
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,640
creating this world.

6
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,960
The more you change things, the quicker the

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,700
projections start to converge on them.

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,780
Converge?

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,900
They attack like white blood cells fighting an

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,360
infection.

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,800
Like they're going to attack us?

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,440
No.

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,620
Let's do it.

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,220
This is great, but I'm telling you, if

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,440
you keep changing things like this...

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,720
Please, mind telling your subconscious to take it

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:35,940
easy?

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,300
It's my subconscious.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,140
Remember, I can't control it.

21
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,530
Very impressive.
